# Brownian-Motion-Simulation

Overview:
This project simulates Brownian motion in both 2D and 3D using Python. It is based on random walk using Gaussian noise, and visualizes particle trajectories over time. The simulation also allows for multiple trials and statistical exploration of final displacements.

Key Concepts:
1.	Random walk and Brownian motion as a collection random walk steps
2.	Use of Gaussian-distributed steps to mimic thermal motion
3.	Visualization of particle trajectories

Methods and Tools:
1.	random
2.	matplotlib
3.	mp1_toolkits 
4.	Google collab

Conclusion:
This simulation demonstrates how random walk processes in 2D and 3D space can model the statistical behavior of Brownian motion. It also shows how increasing the number of particles or steps results in diffusion-like behavior consistent with theory.
